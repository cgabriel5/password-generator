# password-generator

A simple client-side password generator made in JavaScript.

### Live Demo

Generator can be used live [here](https://cgabriel5.github.io/password-generator/).

### Issues

- ~~Copy to clipboard not supported on mobile.~~
- Browsers that do not support the copy to clipboard functionality will default to selecting the newly generated password so the user can then manually copy it.
